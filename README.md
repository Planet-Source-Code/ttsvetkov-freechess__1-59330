## FreeChess

### Description

This is just a new almost-finished chess game. "Almost" because it lacks AI. I had some very big difficulties in creating one, so i decided just to ommit it. This code is just an idea of creating a fully-functional chess game. I called it "FreeChess", because there are no rules of moving the figures on the chessboard. You can do whatever you wish with them. My first intention was to create a simple, but still functional chess game that could be played via Winsock.

- there is a supported multiplayer for 2 people.

- chat system.

- move notifications (like check, checkmate, castling).

- move colors, that show the legal moves for every elected figure, green for moving, red for attacking.

- because of the fact that the chess was intended for buddy playing across WAN or LAN i ommitted all restrictions for moving the figures, thus making it ideal for the people to "undo" their moves if they wish.

- perfect for teaching novices in playing chess.

I hope this code can be of use for your own chess game. Please, if you spot any "BIG" bugs in it, i'm glad to hear your comments :)

PS: I almost forgot to thank Emiliano Scavuzzo for creating the CSocketMaster. It's the best Winsock object you can ever find!
